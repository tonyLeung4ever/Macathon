# SideQuest

University life can be overwhelming â€” making meaningful connections often feels like a high-stakes commitment. Traditional clubs and societies require regular attendance, active group chats, and long waits for events.  
**SideQuest** was born to change that.

SideQuest is a playful platform that delivers **small, personalized "micro-experiences"** students can jump into anytime â€” without the pressure to "keep showing up."  
Instead of filling out boring forms or committing to long-term memberships, students complete a **gamified onboarding**: a series of "Would You Rather?" questions that quietly build a personality profile in the background. Based on their answers, SideQuest matches them to experiences tailored to their vibe â€” not just their schedule.
